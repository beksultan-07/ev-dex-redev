        "text2": "- Envoys Vision DEX provides complete user anonymity when trading cryptocurrencies; However, we require verification (KYC / AML) when trading tokenized assets such as: stocks, bonds, bills and other securities - which makes it possible to legally enforce the right ownership of shares in various companies, ownership, make it possible to receive dividends and real income on the difference in quotations, acquire real estate or art, precious metals, copyrights, etc. Tokenized assets are subject to regulations governing the circulation of securities, and impose responsibility and verification on the companies that issue them.",
        "text3": "- The data of users and companies that have passed verification is stored on a specialized service “KYCAID” that uses 256-bit encryption. SSL in 100% of cases on each device. The Kycaid Limited database complies with the requirements of SSAE 16, ISO 27001 AND PCI DSS V3.0 and HIPAA Compliant.",
        "text4": "- We do not store users' assets, therefore various hacker attacks do not threaten the loss of funds, which significantly distinguishes DEX from centralized exchanges.",
        "text5": "- We don't have a single point of entry through which all assets could be accessed, which complicates the work for crackers and makes the attack itself meaningless;",
        "text6": "- There are no personal accounts on Envoys Vision DEX, verification is required only when trading tokenized assets, when trading cryptocurrencies, you don't even need to specify an email.",
        "text7": "- Envoys Vision DEX leaves users full control over their funds, orders and data, and at the same time full responsibility for their actions.",

        "text8": "- Tokenized assets minimize the role of the depository, reducing its obligations to holding security real shares.",

        "text10": "- Trading tokenized assets is much faster and more technologically advanced thanks to the use of blockchain.",
        "text11": "- An advantage that investors can enjoy is that they don't need a brokerage account to buy assets.",

        "text13": "- Thanks to the blockchain, the regulator will be able to track all transactions, and smart contracts can determine the identity of the buyer, the time of the transaction, the scheme for distributing income or paying dividends. This increases the transparency of transactions.",
        "text14": "- When buying tokenized assets, you can use both regular money (fiat) and cryptocurrencies. The absence of infrastructure barriers and costs gives traders opportunities that were previously available only to institutional investors.",
        "text15": "- Tokenization is well suited for low-liquid assets such as art and real estate. Such high-value assets can be split into tens, hundreds or thousands of low-value tokens, which will increase their liquidity and availability for investors.",
        "text16": "- The tokenization procedure is called “STO” - it is a faster and cheaper analogue of an IPO. Listing costs are reduced due to the absence of the need to involve intermediaries like investment banks. Audit and underwriting procedures for blockchain projects are also easier.

    "farming": {
      "title": "What is farming ?",
      "text": "Cryptocurrency farming (profitable farming) is an important aspect of the DeFi concept. The first step in profitable farming involves adding funds to the liquidity pool. The liquidity pool is a smart contract in which the user's funds are blocked. These pools provide a market (liquidity) where other users can exchange their cryptocurrencies, borrow or lend their tokens. After adding funds to the liquidity pool, the user officially becomes a liquidity provider. In exchange for blocking tokens in the pool, the liquidity provider receives a reward. Rewards are accrued around the clock and are usually paid in the form of tokens. The collected tokens can be invested back into the liquidity pool and added to the farm to receive larger rewards. They can also be withdrawn and converted into cash.",

        "title": "What are the differences in staking ?",
        "text1": "\"Staking\" and \"yield farming\" on DeFi networks allow you to receive passive income. DeFi is a general term for decentralized finance or decentralized financial services for currencies and smart contracts built on blockchain.",
        "text2": "At its core, staking and profitable farming are about the same thing. They involve investing money in one or more cryptocurrencies and collecting interest and commission from transactions on the blockchain. Cryptocurrency needs to be stored in an account so that it collects interest and commissions when funds pass through validators — nodes in the blockchain that support the network. When validators participate in the execution of transactions, stakeholders receive part of the commission.",
        "title2": "What risks can you face ?",
        "text3": "Profitable farming is not only more profitable than stacking, but also riskier.",
        "text4": "Tokens offering such high interest rates and profit from commissions are more likely to drop significantly in price if the main token falls sharply in price. This is called \"impermanent loss\". Even if the commissions brought good earnings, the market value of tokens may decrease, devaluing investments in the farm."
